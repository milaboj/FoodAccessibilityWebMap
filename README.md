# Food Access in Washington State <img src="assets/img/favicon.png" height="40">



Our project is an interactive tool that helps people get a better idea on what food access in our state looks like. Food deserts are an important concept to understand equality issues, but one that isn't yet widely known, especially by the people who might be affected by it. In Washington, food deserts are concentrated in low-income urban and rural areas, such as parts of South Seattle, Yakima, and Spokane. They are areas where residents have limited access to affordable, nutritious food, which has a direct negative impact on their health and quality of life. These disparities are often linked to transportation barriers, systemic inequities, and a lack of nearby grocery stores or fresh-produce markets. Our target audience is Washington residents that don't know much about this concept or people that are curious about what patterns within this theme exist close to them. 

This website has two maps that come together to illustrate the supply limitations (distance to grocery stores) and an example of a solution to this barrier (SNAP benefits). Users are able to look up an address or selected point's distance to the nearest grocery store on the first map, and then use their finds to analyze the number households enrolled on SNAP benefits in each county. Hopefully, this will raise awareness that this lack of access isn't a coincidence – there are spatial motifs that can be addressed. 

The SNAP benefits map is an interactive choropleth visualization that illustrates household participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) using county-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Instead of mapping raw counts alone, the project uses normalized data, calculating the proportion of households receiving SNAP in each county. This approach allows users to make meaningful comparisons between counties with very different population sizes, highlighting where SNAP participation is relatively high or low on a per-household basis.

Each county is shaded according to its normalized SNAP participation rate, creating a visual gradient that shows geographic patterns across the United States. Hovering over a county displays the exact number of households enrolled in SNAP as well as the county’s normalized percentage. When a user clicks on a county, additional food access indicators appear, including the percentage of residents living more than 0.5 miles, 1 mile, 10 miles, and 20 miles from a food source. These combined metrics help illustrate how SNAP participation aligns with spatial barriers to food, offering insights into the relationship between economic need, geographic accessibility, and food system equity.

The Food Facility Finder map illustrates food accessibility in a simple, down-to-earth way by showing the physical locations of food sources across King County. The map displays point locations for all food facilities in the county, including grocery stores, restaurants, school cafeterias, convenience stores, and other places where residents can purchase or access food. Each point is fully interactive: when users click on a specific location, a pop-up appears showing the facility’s name, address, and basic identifying information.

In addition to browsing individual points, users can search any address within King County to instantly view the closest food facility from the county’s dataset. This feature helps people understand how food accessibility varies depending on where someone lives, works, or goes to school.

Our goal was to create an intuitive, user-friendly tool that allows people to explore real differences in access across the county. By visualizing how far residents in different neighborhoods must travel to reach even the most basic food sources, the map highlights the daily effort - whether small or substantial - that people may need to invest simply to secure food.

AI disclosure: The favicon was generated by ChatGPT with requested edits. 
ChatGPT has been used in the creation of this web map to generate and debug code for the facility finder map. 
Initially, we used ChatGPT to generate a starting template for the website and used it to debug our code. When we encountered formatting issues we would copy codes into the chats to ask AI on tips to fix it. For example, when we added the image in the overview page, it was oversized and only showed a corner of it. I asked ChatGPT what I could do to fix it and it gave me directions for it.
To refine our website's visuals, We also used ChatGPT for help with finding examples on how to style the CSS of our website. The first iteration ChatGPT provided was plain and simple, so we edited the CSS to make it more eyecatching. We asked ChatGPT if it would be better to use bright or dark colors, and for tips on what type of colours to use. When there were issues with the CSS code, we also used ChatGPT for debugging. 

Applied libraries (e.g., mapbox gl js) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use: Mapbox, GitHub Pages.
