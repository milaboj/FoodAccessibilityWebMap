        <p>
            Our project is an interactive tool that helps people get a better idea on what food access in our state
            looks like. Food deserts are an important concept to understand equality issues, but one that isn't yet
            widely known, especially by the people who might be affected by it. In Washington, food deserts are
            concentrated in low-income urban and rural areas, such as parts of South Seattle, Yakima, and Spokane.
            They are areas where residents have limited access to affordable, nutritious food, which has a direct
            negative impact on their health and quality of life. These disparities are often linked to transportation
            barriers, systemic inequities, and a lack of nearby grocery stores or fresh produce markets. Our target
            audience is Washington residents that don't know much about this concept or people that are curious about
            what patterns within this theme exist close to them.

            This website has two maps that come together to illustrate the supply limitations (distance to grocery
            stores) and an example of a solution to this barrier (SNAP benefits). Users are able to look up an address
            or selected point's distance to the nearest grocery store on the first map, and then use their findings to
            analyze the number households enrolled in SNAP benefits in each county. Hopefully, this will raise
            awareness that this lack of access isn't a coincidence – there are spatial motifs that can be addressed.

            The SNAP benefits map is a choropleth map that visualizes the household participation in the Supplemental
            Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) using county-level data from the U.S Census Bureau. Each county is
            shaded based on the number of households receiving SNAP benefits. When hovering over a county,
            users are able to see the exact number of households enrolled in SNAP for that area. Clicking on a specific
            county reveals additional stats by showing food access data including the percentage of the county's
            population living more than 0.5 miles, 1 mile, 10 miles, and 20 miles of a food source, helping users
            understand how SNAP participation and food accessibility intersect.
