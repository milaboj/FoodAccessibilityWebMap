        <h1>Food Access in Washington State</h1>

        <p>
            Our project is an interactive tool that helps people get a better idea on what food access in our state
            looks like. Food deserts are an important concept to understand equality issues, but one that isn't yet
            widely known, especially by the people who might be affected by it. In Washington, food deserts are concentrated
             in low-income urban and rural areas, such as parts of South Seattle, Yakima, and Spokane. They are areas where 
             residents have limited access to affordable, nutritious food, which has a direct negative impact on their health
              and quality of life. These disparities are often linked to transportation barriers, systemic inequities, and a 
              lack of nearby grocery stores or fresh-produce markets. Our target audience is Washington residents that don't
               know much about this concept or people that are curious about what patterns within this theme exist close to them.

            This website has two maps that come together to illustrate the supply limitations (distance to grocery
            stores) and an example of a solution (SNAP benefits). Users are able to look up an address or selected 
            point's distance to the nearest grocery store on the first map, and then use their finds to analyze the 
            number households enrolled on SNAP benefits in each county. Hopefully, this will raise awareness that this
             lack of access isn't a coincidence – there are spatial motifs that can be addressed.

            The SNAP benefits map is a choropleth map that visualizes the household participation in the Supplementantal
            Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) using county level data from the U.S Census Bureau. Each county is shaded
            based on the number of households recivng SNAP benifits. When hovering over a county, users are able to see 
            the exact number of households enrolled in SNAP for that area. Clicking on a specific county reveals additional
            stats by showing food access data including the percentage of the county's population living more than 0.5 miles,
            1 mile, 10 miles, and 20 miles of a food source, helping users understand how SNAP participation and 
            food accessibility intersects.
