        Food deserts are an important concept to understand equality issues, but one that isn't yet widely known,
        especially by the people who might be affected by it. In Washington, food deserts are concentrated in
        low-income urban and rural areas, such as parts of South Seattle, Yakima, and Spokane. They are areas where
        residents have limited access to affordable, nutritious food, which has a direct negative impact on their
        health and quality of life. These disparities are often linked to transportation barriers, systemic inequities,
        and a lack of nearby grocery stores or fresh-produce markets. If you're a WA resident who doesn't know much
        about this concept or are curious about what patterns within this theme exist close to you, you're in the right place.

        Browse to learn more about supply limitations and SNAP benefits, which are an example of a solution to remediate this scenario.
        You can look up an address or selected point's distance to the nearest grocery store on the Closest Grocery Store page,
        and then use these finds to analyze the number of households enrolled on SNAP benefits in each county on Snap Benefits.
        Hopefully, this will raise awareness that this lack of access isn't a coincidence – there are spatial motifs that can
        be addressed.
