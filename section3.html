        <h1>Analysis of Food Accessibility</h1>
        <p>This section provides an in-depth analysis of food accessibility based on the data visualized in the previous sections
            Based on the previous maps, we can observe several key patterns regarding food accessibility in the area.
            The areas that are near downtown Seattle tend to have a higher density of grocery stores, which likely contributes to better food accessibility for residents in these regions.
            Conversely, the outskirts of the city show a noticeable decrease in grocery store density, indicating potential food deserts where residents may face challenges in accessing fresh and affordable food options.
            Additionally, the proximity to public transportation routes appears to play a significant role in food accessibility.
            Areas well-served by public transit tend to have better access to grocery stores, suggesting that transportation infrastructure is a critical factor in ensuring food accessibility for all residents.
            Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of considering both geographic and infrastructural factors when addressing food accessibility issues in urban areas.
