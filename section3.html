        <p>By browsing these maps and combining findings, 
        we can observe several key patterns regarding food accessibility in the area. 
        Busier commercial areas such as downtown Seattle, for example, tend to have a higher 
        density of grocery stores, contributing to better food accessibility for residents in 
        these regions – or those who frequent these spaces, suggesting that transportation 
        infrastructure is a factor in ensuring food accessibility for all residents. 
        <br>
        Conversely, the outskirts of the city show a noticeable decrease in grocery store density, 
        indicating potential food deserts where residents may face challenges in accessing 
        fresh and affordable food options. These are also areas usually associated with 
        less public transportation coverage, adding another layer to food accessibility.
        <br>
        Overall, it's important to note both geographic and infrastructural factors when 
        addressing food accessibility issues in urban areas. Keep an eye out for your community!
